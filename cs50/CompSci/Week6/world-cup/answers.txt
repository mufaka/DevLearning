Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Switzerland jumped up in percentage from 10 to 100 simulations but back down beyond that.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000. There wasn't much difference between 10000, 100000, and 1000000 but from 1000 to 10000 there was noticeable difference.
